## 🎮 Mission Control System

### Quick Start

```bash
# Start the complete system with dashboard
python3 mission_control_center_v2.py
```

### Configuration

Edit `config/mission_control.yaml` to customize:
- Agent enabling/disabling
- Health check intervals
- Dashboard refresh rates
- Consolidation settings

## 📋 Available Missions

### 1. Monorepo Consolidation
**Objective**: Eliminate duplicate files, merge redundant modules, create unified structure

**Phases**:
1. **Analysis & Backup** - Create backups and analyze dependencies
2. **Safe Consolidation** - Remove obvious duplicates and merge simple files
3. **Module Integration** - Merge redundant modules and update dependencies
4. **Validation & Optimization** - Test consolidated system and optimize structure

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero data loss
- All tests passing
- Reduced file count by >30%
- Improved system performance

## 🔧 System Features

### Real-Time Dashboard
- Live system status monitoring
- Agent health indicators
- Mission progress tracking
- Performance metrics

### Risk Assessment
- File operation risk analysis
- Consolidation confidence scoring
- Automated safety recommendations
- Rollback capabilities

### Blockchain Integration
- Transaction logging for all operations
- Proof generation for consolidation events
- Integrity verification
- CTR smart contract integration (when available)

### Self-Healing
- Automatic error recovery
- Operation rollback on failures
- Backup creation before risky operations
- Health monitoring and alerting

## 📊 System Status Indicators

### Agent Status
- `active` - Agent running normally
- `initializing` - Agent starting up
- `degraded` - Agent running with issues
- `error` - Agent encountered errors
- `shutdown` - Agent stopped

### Mission Status
- `planned` - Mission created but not started
- `executing` - Mission currently running
- `completed` - Mission finished successfully
- `failed` - Mission encountered errors
- `cancelled` - Mission stopped by user

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

### Dependencies
```txt
asyncio
json
logging
hashlib
pathlib
dataclasses
subprocess
PyYAML>=6.0
```

### Python Version
- Python 3.8+ required
- Tested with Python 3.9+

### System Requirements
- Linux/Unix environment
- Write permissions in workspace
- Network access (for blockchain operations)

## 🔐 Security Features

- File validation before operations
- Operation logging for audit trails
- Integrity checks for all modifications
- Backup verification

## 📈 Performance Monitoring

### Metrics Tracked
- File operation success rates
- Agent response times
- Mission completion times
- System resource usage
- Error frequencies

### Optimization Features
- Batch processing for large operations
- Incremental consolidation approach
- Resource-aware scheduling
- Performance-based task routing

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### Manual Shutdown
Press `Ctrl+C` in the dashboard or send SIGTERM to the process

### System Recovery
1. Check logs in `logs/` directory
2. Review last backup in `backups/`
3. Examine state files in `state/`
4. Use rollback procedures if needed

### Backup Recovery
```bash
# Restore from backup (example)
cp -r backups/backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS/* ./
```
