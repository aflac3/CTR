    internal view returns (bool)

function performAMLCheck(string memory cedaiId, address issuer) 
    internal view returns (bool)

// Risk-based monitoring
uint256 public riskScore;
mapping(address => uint256) public customerRiskLevel;
```

bytes32 public constant REGULATORY_REPORTER_ROLE = keccak256("REGULATORY_REPORTER_ROLE");
bytes32 public constant AUDITOR_ROLE = keccak256("AUDITOR_ROLE");

// Cryptographic integrity
bytes32 public zkProofCommitment;
bytes32 public entryHash;

// Emergency controls
function pause(string memory reason) public onlyRole(EMERGENCY_OPERATOR_ROLE)
```
